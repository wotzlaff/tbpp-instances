# Benchmark Instances for the Temporal Bin Packing Problem (with Fire-Ups)

## Part (A)
The instances were introduced in [[1]](#1).
A part of (small instances) are available at <https://github.com/sibirbil/TemporalBinPacking>.

## Part (B)
The instances are generated from a subset of instances of the Temporal Knapsack Problem (TKP).
The TKP instances can be found [here](http://or.dei.unibo.it/library).
